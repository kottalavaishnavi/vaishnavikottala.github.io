      <h1>Vaishnavi Kottala</h1>
      <p>Charleston, WV, United States · vaishnavikottala2911@gmail.com</p>
      <p>I am a Full Stack Developer and Researcher with 4+ years of combined experience in full-stack development, AI-powered cybersecurity, backend automation, and cloud deployments. My core expertise lies in developing scalable enterprise applications using Java, Spring Boot, Python, REST APIs, React, Angular, and AWS, along with research contributions in AI-driven defense mechanisms for 5G networks and critical infrastructure. I have co-authored 16+ research papers, published and presented through IEEE conferences, contributing innovative solutions to AI, cybersecurity, and machine learning domains.

In the industry, I have worked with organizations such as West Virginia State University and Motivity Labs. At West Virginia State University, I led research on AI-powered cybersecurity threat detection, achieving 100% detection accuracy with minimal false positives. During my time at Motivity Labs, I developed and deployed full-stack applications, automated backend processes using Java, and implemented Angular components to trigger the live events and decrease human dependency by 95%, integrating secure database architectures with MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. My work involved managing microservices architecture, secure RESTful API integrations, and participating in Agile development lifecycles.

I am seeking full-time opportunities where I can leverage my expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven cybersecurity, cloud engineering, and enterprise software development to contribute to innovative projects and continuous growth within dynamic organizations. </p>
